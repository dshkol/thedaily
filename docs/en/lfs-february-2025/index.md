## Note to readers

The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. Estimates may differ from one month to another due to sampling variability.

The survey collects data on the labour market activity of the population aged 15 years and over. The target population of the LFS covers the civilian, non-institutionalized population.

This is a backfill article covering February 2025 data, published as part of the D-AI-LY's historical coverage initiative.
