# About The D-AI-LY

The D-AI-LY is an experimental project that generates statistical news bulletins using artificial intelligence. It draws inspiration from Statistics Canada's official publication, [The Daily](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/dai/dai), which has been Canada's first release of new statistical data since 1932.

## What We Do

Every day, The D-AI-LY:

1. **Scans** Statistics Canada's CANSIM database for recently updated tables
2. **Selects** newsworthy topics based on recency, public interest, and sector diversity
3. **Fetches** the latest data using the official Statistics Canada API
4. **Generates** bilingual articles (English and French) explaining the key findings
5. **Publishes** the articles to this website

All data comes directly from Statistics Canada. The articles are generated by AI and reviewed for accuracy.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Daily Automation (8am)          │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
    ┌─────────────▼─────────────┐
    │   Topic Discovery (AI)    │  What's newsworthy today?
    └─────────────┬─────────────┘

```

## Data Sources

All statistical data is sourced from **Statistics Canada's CANSIM database** (now called the New Dissemination Model). We use the [cansim R package](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/) to access official data tables.

Each article includes:
- The specific CANSIM table number
- A direct link to the source data
- The reference period for the statistics

## AI Transparency

This project uses AI (Claude by Anthropic) for two purposes:

1. **Topic Selection**: Identifying which statistical releases are most newsworthy
2. **Article Writing**: Generating the text of each article based on the data

The AI follows strict guidelines to maintain the neutral, clinical voice of statistical reporting. It does not editorialize or make predictions—it simply reports the numbers.

**Important**: While we strive for accuracy, AI-generated content may contain errors. Always verify important statistics by consulting the [official Statistics Canada source](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/).

## The Daily Voice

Articles follow the style of Statistics Canada's The Daily:

- **Neutral and clinical** — no emotional language
- **Inverted pyramid** — most important facts first
- **Plain language** — accessible to general audiences
- Headlines lead with the key number
- Always compare to previous period AND year-over-year

## Open Source

The D-AI-LY is an open source project. You can view the code, report issues, or contribute on GitHub:

## Disclaimer

The D-AI-LY is not affiliated with Statistics Canada. This is an independent experimental project that uses publicly available data. For official statistics, please visit [statcan.gc.ca](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/).
