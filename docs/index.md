## About this project

The D-AI-LY is an experimental project that uses large language models to generate statistical bulletins from Statistics Canada data releases. Articles are produced automatically from official CANSIM tables.

This is not an official Statistics Canada publication. Data comes from public sources, but narrative and analysis are AI-generated. Verify figures with [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca).
