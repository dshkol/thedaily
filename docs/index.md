## About

The D-AI-LY is an experimental project using large language models to generate statistical bulletins from Statistics Canada data. Articles are produced automatically from official CANSIM tables.

**Not an official Statistics Canada publication.** Data comes from public sources; narrative and analysis are AI-generated. [Verify figures with Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca).
